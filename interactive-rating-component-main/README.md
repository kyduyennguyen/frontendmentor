## Overview

### The challenge

This challenge is to build out the interactive rating component and keeping it as near to the design as possible.

I use VS Code tools to complete the challenge. But if you've got other tools you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Make sure Users could:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating
