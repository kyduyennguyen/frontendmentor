- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen or in other media. And how to use external stylesheets are stored in CSS file. Besides, I known how to set position for elements.

### Continued development

I'm going to update my QR code and set color for background because I think current background color is too dark. And edit contents of guideline below QR code.
